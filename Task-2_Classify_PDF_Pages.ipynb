        "\n",
        "Objective:\n",
        "Implement the `classify_page` function within the given code structure to classify each page of a PDF file into one of three categories based on its content and readability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Structure:\n",
        "The main function `classify_all_pages` is already implemented, but if necessary you are allowed to change its implementation. Your task is to complete the `classify_page` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Input:\n",
        "- A PDF file path (the function should be able to handle various PDF files)\n",
        "\n",
        "Output:\n",
        "- A list of integers, where each integer represents the class of a page in the PDF\n",
        "\n",
        "Classification Categories:\n",
        "\n",
        "0: Machine-readable / searchable\n",
        "   - Pages with text that can be directly extracted and searched within the PDF\n",
        "\n",
        "1: Non-machine readable but OCR-able\n",
        "   - Pages containing text that isn't directly extractable but can be recognized through OCR\n",
        "   - Essentially, these are pages with visible text but stored as images\n",
        "\n",
        "2: Non-machine readable and not OCR-able\n",
        "   - Pages without any recognizable text\n",
        "   - This may include pages with only images, complex graphics, or blank pages\n",
        "\n",
        "Task:\n",
        "1. Implement the `classify_page` function:\n",
        "   - Input: A single page object (PdfReader.PageObject)\n",
        "   - Output: An integer (0, 1, or 2) representing the page's class\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The function should analyze the content of the page and determine its class based on the categories described above.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Ensure your implementation is robust and can handle various types of PDF content.\n",
        "\n",
        "Requirements:\n",
        "1. The function should work with different PDF files, not just a specific one.\n",
        "2. Implement methods to distinguish between the three categories accurately.\n",
        "3. Handle potential exceptions or edge cases (e.g., corrupted pages, mixed content types on a single page).\n",
        "4. Optimize for both accuracy and processing speed, as the function will be called for each page in the PDF.\n",
        "5. You are allowed to use up to 40GB of GPU VRAM if necessary for your implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additional Considerations:\n",
        "- You may use additional libraries if needed, but ensure they are imported properly.\n",
        "- Provide clear comments in your code to explain the classification logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "Testing:\n",
        "- Test your implementation with various types of PDFs to ensure its robustness and generalizability.\n",
        "- The main script provides a way to test your implementation on a file named \"grouped_documents.pdf\".\n"
